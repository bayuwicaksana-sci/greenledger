# Project Goals

**GreenLedger** - Agriculture Science Division Financial Management System

# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

## **Background**

The Agriculture Science Division is currently facing significant challenges in managing operational finances. As a highly mobile research division with field teams spread across multiple sites (Klaten and Magelang), a manual Excel-based system is no longer adequate to support the operational complexity and high accountability requirements.

## **Pain Points**

- The manual Excel system is not scalable for mobile teams and multi-site operations
- Documentation is unstructured and difficult to archive with a proper audit trail
- Workflow approvals via email cause bottlenecks and loss of documentation
- There is no real-time budget monitoring or visibility for decision-making
- The settlement process is not properly controlled (no timeout, no tracking)
- Coordination between Jakarta (FO) and Sites (FA Klaten/Magelang) is not efficient

## **Proposed Solutions**

Development of an integrated financial management system specifically designed for the needs of a legally established research foundation organization with the following characteristics:

- Configurable multi-level approval workflow
- Real-time budget monitoring per research topic and sub-division
- Automated settlement tracking with SLA enforcement (2-7 days)
- Flexible payment mechanisms (Cash Advance, Reimbursement, Direct Payment)
- Asset tracking for fixed assets and non-consumable items
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance and accountability
- Integrated communication (in-app chat) between requester and finance team

## **Expected Benefits**

| **Accountability**         | Enforced settlement SLA with auto-blocking mechanism for non-compliance                    |
| **Collaboration**          | Seamless coordination between FO (Jakarta) and FA (Sites) through integrated communication |
